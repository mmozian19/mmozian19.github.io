	  <title>First Year</title>
	  
	  <p> I had never been to even the state of Maine before coming here this summer to visit the school.  I really like it here and have met many people that I feel lucky to have gotten to know.  I am majoring in finance and have grown more and more interested inn my major as time goes on. I plan on joining some clubs soon to meet even more interesting people. </p>
