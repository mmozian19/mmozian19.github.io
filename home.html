	  <p> Hi, My name is Michael Mozian.  I'm from Greenwich, Ct which is in the bottom corner of Connecticut. <a href="hockey.html"> Hockey</a> has been a big part of my life growing up.  It has brought me closer to many people including my brother, who was my teammate for many years. I come from a averaged sized four person <a href="family.html"> family </a> family.  Other than my mother and father, I have a brother named Alex who is two years younger than me.  We get along very well because Alex and I played on the same line during our highschool hockey careers. As a family we enjoy going on vacation and watching tv together.  I decided to come up to University of Maine for my education and am currently working on a degree in Finance.  I've had a great <a href="firstyear.html"> first year at University of Maine </a> so far and I have met tons of great people from different backgrounds. <P>
