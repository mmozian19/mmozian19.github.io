<P> I've Been playing hockey since I was 3 years old.  I grew up playing for teams that played locally, but have been to tournaments all over Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, and Canada.  My favorite years of hockey were when I played for my highschool because we actually had people coming to watch pur games. I loved playing my senior year because I was able to be on the same line as my younger brother who although was only a sophomore, was good enough to be with me on the starting line.  The two of us not only worked well to assist each other with most of our goals, we were also the top two leading point scorers on the team by at least 10 points.  I was most proud of myself after that year of hockey because I had worked so hard all summer to become an impact player on the team.  I went from being a third line player with three goals for the season to a top player in the whole state of Connecticut.  I made the All-County and  All-State teams.  I was also selected as the player of the week 3 times throughout the season.  I also had 2 goals and 2 assists in the championship game of our county's playoffs and was awarded the league MVP and made many GHS hockey alumni happy because it was not only the first time we had won this championship in 7 years but it was also the first time we had beaten our town rivals Darien in over 10 years. </p>
